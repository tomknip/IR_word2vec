    "The idea of the information retrieval system is as follows.\n",
    "User 1 has sports as a preference. The profile vector consists of \"Tennis\", \"Football\", \"Rugby\". User 2 has cars as a preference. The profile vector may for example consist of \"BMW\", \"Engine\", \"Wheels\". There is a new document called: \"Tennis is healthy\". The score to user 1 is 0.9 and the score to user 2 is 0. The document is sent to user 1 because it is above the threshold of 0.5 (for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps that are part of the information retrieval system are:\n",
    "1. Build profile vector\n",
    "2. New incoming document transformation into keywords\n",
    "3. Calculate score of new, prepared document that enters the system\n",
    "4. If score > threshold, recommend to user\n",
    "5. Let user provide feedback\n",
    "6. Adapt the profile according to the profile and the feedback provided\n",
